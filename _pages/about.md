I am a third year M.Sc student (2022.09-present) in Software Engineering at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology. I am supervised by [Prof. Yu Xue](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/xueyu/zh_CN/index/69265/list/index.htm). My research focuses on Deep Learning, Neural Architecture Search, and Evolutionary Computation. Under Prof. Xue' supervision, I have a close coopearation with [Prof. Ferrante Neri](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/ferrante-neri) and [Prof. Moncef Gabbouj](https://www.tuni.fi/en/people/moncef-gabbouj). Currently, I am engaged in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and aim to fine-tune and lightweight Large Machine Learning Models by NAS in the future.
