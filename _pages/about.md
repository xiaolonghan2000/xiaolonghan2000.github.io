I am a Ph.D. student (2025 Fall - Present) in Computer Science at [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/). I am supervised by [Prof. Ferrante Neri](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/ferrante-neri) and [Assistant Prof. Lu Yin](https://luuyin.com/). My research focuses on Deep Learning, Weight Space Learning, Neural Architecture Search, and Evolutionary Computation. I used to have a cooperation with [Prof. Yu Xue](https://faculty.nuist.edu.cn/xueyu/zh_CN/index/69265/list/index.htm) and [Prof. Moncef Gabbouj](https://www.tuni.fi/en/people/moncef-gabbouj) on the topic of Neural Architecture Search. Currently, I am engaged in Weight Space Learning (WSL), and aim to explore it from the perspective of generation model.
